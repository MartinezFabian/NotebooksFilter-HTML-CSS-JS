# Notebooks Filter

This project aims to practice the implementation of a filtered search using JavaScript. The goal is to create an interactive web application that allows users to filter a list of notebooks according to different criteria, such as price, brand, processor, screen size, screen resolution and RAM.

Standard web technologies, including HTML, CSS and JavaScript, will be used to build the user interface and handle the filtering logic. The project will provide a seamless user experience and allow users to easily browse and find notebooks that fit their needs.

Through this project, I will seek to improve web development skills and understand the fundamental concepts of searching and filtering data using JavaScript.
